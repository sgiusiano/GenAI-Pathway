He’s all smiles, his car perfectly positioned for a victory. \n\nBut as the cameras zoom in for the celebration, they see something unusual on the Ferrari’s steering wheel. There, mounted on the right side of Vettel's steering wheel, sits a third paddle. Not the standard clutch and gear-change paddles every driver uses, but something else. \n\nToday, we're going inside the most complex piece of equipment any racing driver touches—the Formula One steering wheel. \n\nAnd I managed to get access to the Racing Bulls factory, where their Head of Electronics walked me through twenty years of steering wheel evolution and showed me the secrets that most people never get to see. \n\nWe'll uncover how teams have pushed the boundaries of what's legal, what's possible, and what borders on genius. \n\n📢 Advertise to 7.3 million F1, motorsport and Engineering fans: https://driver61.com/advertise/\n\n👉 My other socials:\n- Instagram - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Insta\n- Facebook - OfficialDriver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Facebook\n- TikTok - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61TikTok\n- Twitter - https://twitter.com/scottkmansell\n\n🛞 My Sim Kit:\n- Fanatec DD2: https://bit.ly/driver61-fanatec\n- SImlabs P1X Pro: https://simlab.prf.hn/l/ZZ9AkG5\n\n#RacingBulls #F1 #SteeringWheel",

While other teams watch their tyres overheat and performance drop off, McLaren somehow keeps their rubber in the perfect operating window lap after lap.\n\nRed Bull suspects water cooling. They reportedly have thermal images showing \"cold spots\" on McLaren's brake drums, to which McLaren basically said protest us!\n\nBut what's their secret? Well, the answer might lie in something called phase change materials. And to find out more - I spoke with Martin Buchan, who was an F1 engineer, and wrote his thesis at McLaren about this exact technology eight years ago.\n\n📢 Advertise to 7.3 million F1, motorsport and Engineering fans: https://driver61.com/advertise/\n\n📹 All source footage can be found here: https://bit.ly/454uF7s\n\n👉 My other socials:\n- Instagram - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Insta\n- Facebook - OfficialDriver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Facebook\n- TikTok - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61TikTok\n- Twitter - https://twitter.com/scottkmansell\n\n🛞 My Sim Kit:\n- Fanatec DD2: https://bit.ly/driver61-fanatec\n- SImlabs P1X Pro: https://simlab.prf.hn/l/ZZ9AkG5\n\n#McLaren #F1 #MartinBuchan",

So, I went to Italy to see how F1 helmets are made, and to a shooting range to see if they are indeed bulletproof. \n\nStilo, who make helmets for a number of F1 drivers, gave me unprecedented access to their factory to see the entire process of creating an F1 helmet, from design, manufacturing, and testing - and it genuinely was one of the most fascinating things I’ve ever seen.\n\nSo, where do you start when designing a helmet that saves lives? Not from the outside, but from the inside.\n\n📢 Advertise to 7.3 million F1, motorsport and Engineering fans: https://driver61.com/advertise/\n\n📹 All source footage can be found here: https://bit.ly/43mJW2M\n\n👉 My other socials:\n- Instagram - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Insta\n- Facebook - OfficialDriver61 - https://bit.ly/D61Facebook\n- TikTok - @official_driver61 - https://bit.ly/D61TikTok\n- Twitter - https://twitter.com/scottkmansell\n\n🛞 My Sim Kit:\n- Fanatec DD2: https://bit.ly/driver61-fanatec\n- SImlabs P1X Pro: https://simlab.prf.hn/l/ZZ9AkG5\n\n#Helmets #F1 #Stilo",
